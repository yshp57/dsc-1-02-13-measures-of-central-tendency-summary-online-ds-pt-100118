    "### Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are work with a small set of data values, it is often possible to discuss these values individually. However when we are dealing or working with large sets of data in real world problems, we prefer to have some features that can summarize and represent the data in a concise format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we shall look at such measures first for a single data variable. e.g.,  the salary of workers in a particular factory. These measures will include measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term *Central Tendency* or a *Measure of central tendency* is the **typical** or **central** value for a data distribution. It is also commonly known as just the *Center* the distribution. If you weren't becoming a data scientist, you might just call it the \"average\", but it turns out that there are different types of \"averages\" that work better for answering different sorts of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main measures of central tendency: the mean, the median and the mode. Each of these measures describes a different way of indicating the typical or central value in the data as we shall wee below. \n"

    "> Yes, we're using the dreaded \"mathematical notation\". It's OK. It's just a concise way to write things down. It's along (along with long, confusion model names like \"Recurrent Neural Networks\") one of the ways that data scientists make so much money. The math and the long words scare people away from ideas that are actually pretty straightforward!\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're a math whiz, great. If not, take a little time to look at an unpack the formulae we show in this course. Over time it'll become second nature and that's going to be really important as a practicing data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with the $\\bar{x}$ (x-bar) - the bar over the top just means \"this is the mean\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean value, shown as $\\bar{x}$ (x-bar) for a vector $X$ is achieved by adding together all values of $X$ (shown as as $\\sum{X}$),  and dividing $N$ (Number of observations).\n",
    "e.g. Letâ€™s look at a very simple set of data representing the retirement age of 11 individuals\n",

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The median is another measure of central tendency. It refers to the data situated at exactly the middle location of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a set with an odd number of data points the median is the middle value. So the median of 2, 4, 12 is 4. In our retirement data above, as we have 11 values, we can pick the 6th value (57) to be our median.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of data points is even then the median is the average (mean) of the two middle items. Let's look at this dataset for average weight of 10 individuals:\n",
    "```\n",
    "55, 56, 56, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 70, 78\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, for the even number of observations (i.e. 10), the median would be calculated as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Median = (60 + 61)/2 = 60.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might we want to use the median instead of the mean? Well imagine there are 10 people sitting in a bar. All of them make \\$50k a year. A hedge fund manager comes in who makes \\$20m a year. The \"average\" (mean) salary of people in the bar is now just over \\$1.86m a year! It is true, but it might be misleading if you relied on that data to ask any of the first 10 people to loan you \\$500k!\n",
    "\n",
    "So medians are particularly useful for data sets where there are a number of significant outliers (like the hedge fund managers salary) and you want to get a sense of a \"representative\" measure of centrality. If we looked at the median salary in the bar, it'd still be \\$50k even with the hedge fund manager. It'd be a little misleading for that one person but would give you a better sense of the kind of salary that most people in the bar made."

    "### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mode refers to the data value that occurs most frequently in a given data set. Hence, it uses the frequency (repetition) of a certain value to be a representative of central tendency of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our retirement data above, we can see that the value 54 appears most frequently (i.e. 3 times). So the mode value for retirement age , based on our data , would be 54 years. Similarly for the weight data, the value 56 appears more frequently than the rest and hence would be considered a mode for this data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If two (or more) values occur with the same frequency in a dataset, both (or all) of the items are considered the mode of the data and the data set is **multimodal**. (Multimodality and its impact data analysis will be discussed later in the course.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is particularly useful for categorical data (data grouped into categories) and is often used for filling in missing data in a messy data set. However, it's important to look at a plot of the distribution of data before using the mode to represent centrality as sometimes the most popular category will not be centrally positioned."

    "Here we can see that the we can see that mean value i.e. 56.6 do not fully reflect the typical behavior of this particular data if we wanted to use this as a representative figure for retirement age. The median i.e. 57 also fails to represent the general tendency found in this dataset. The mode, i.e. 54 shows the most frequency value which could be used as a representative value. Such decisions, however, are subjective and may differ based on the analytical question asked. For this example, average or median may still be used to reflect the overall range of values present in the dataset. \n",

For such distributions, the median is often a preferred measure of central tendency, as the mean does not clearly reflect the central tendency. BAsed on the direction of mean's movement, such distributions can be further categorized as positively or negatively skewed distributions as shown below:\n",

    "Outliers are extreme, or unusual data value(s) that are notably different from the rest of the data. It is important to detect outliers within a distribution, because they can alter the results of the data analysis. The mean is more sensitive to the existence of outliers than the median or mode. \n",

    "The new value is unusual as it is much higher than the other values, and hence considered an *outlier*. \n",

    "```\n",
    " 54+54+54+55+56+57+57+58+58+60+81 = 644 divided by 11 = 58.5 years\n",

    "So we see that In this distribution the outlier value has increased the mean value. However, it has not changed the middle of the distribution, and therefore the median value is still 57 years. \n",

    "Despite the existence of outliers in a distribution, the mean can still be an appropriate measure of central tendency, especially if the rest of the data is normally distributed. If the outlier is confirmed as a valid extreme value, it should treated accordingly. "
